Since while loop runs for n iterations, it will run function doSomething() n times. So it gives time complexity of n*O(1) which is O(n).2.) Since while loop runs for n/2 iterations, it will run function doSomething() n/2 times. So it gives time complexity of n/2*O(n) which is O(n^2).3.) Since while loop runs for log n iterations, it will run function doSomething() log n times. So it gives time complexity of log n*O(m) which is O(m*logn).4.) Since while loop runs for n iterations, it will run function doSomething() n times. So it gives time complexity of n*O(m!) which is O(n*m!).Question 3 a): In this part for loop will run n times and for every, i inner while loop also runs for n times so n*n means that the worst-case time complexity will be O(n2). b): suppose that alist has the size n then in this case outer for loop will run n times and the inner loop will also run n times in worst case when j=i. So for this also, worst case time complexity will be O(n2). C): Here also outer loop will run n times and the inner loop is increasing in the form j=j*2 so for the inner loop the time complexity will be Log(n) because a loop is considered as O(logn) if the loop variables are divided/multiplied by a constant amount. So overall worst case time complexity will be nlog(n).Question 4Best Case:We will get the best case when the case is closed.When the case is closed, we will just append it to the list and return the empty list because there are no related cases.It will take O(1) time.Worst Case:When the case is not closed, then we will get the worst case when we have several tags matching the case.When the case is still open, we will search for each search term in the keywords and closed cases and append the matching case that is already closed.So, It will take   O(Number of keywords in the curretncase * Number of closed cases) time.O(n*m)
Size input Parameters:The input parameters are:1. case• It is a single dict and the size is O(1) 2. closed_cases• It is a LIST OF CASES each of 3 items.• So, the size is O(length of closed_cases).So, let's take an example of closed cases=[case1,case2,case3,.....case10]current case is an opened case having 5 keywords and we have to loop through each keyword and for each of the closed case.So, we will take 5*10=50 comparisons.If the case is closed , then we will perform only one append operation. Larry is right only if it’s the best case.Question 7 B)620167960Question 7 C)For the base case, the leftmost column and bottommost row, will have all values as 1. marioCount() returns 1 if base case.Question 7 D)For other cells on (i, j), it will be sum of cost on (i+1, j) and (i, j-1). It is made smaller by first moving down a row and up a column individually and then adding their cost for (i+1, j) and (i, j-1) which is the main task. It is important to first solve the smaller problem which is counting the steps he takes for each row and column individually first.

Quite a large amount of time compared to fibm probably around like 12-15 seconds2. Whereas the memoized functions took maybe 1 second to run and display the output.Activity: Moosonacci numbers	After applying the memoization technique to the function moosonacci it began running just as fast as the fibm (memoized version of Fibonacci).

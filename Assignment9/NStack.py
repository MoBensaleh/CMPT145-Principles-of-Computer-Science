# CMPT 145: Node-Based Data Structures
# Implements the Stack ADT
#
# A stack (also called a pushdown or LIFO stack) is a compound 
# data structure in which the data values are ordered according 
# to the LIFO (last-in first-out) protocol.
#
# Implementation:
# This implementation uses the linked node structure.

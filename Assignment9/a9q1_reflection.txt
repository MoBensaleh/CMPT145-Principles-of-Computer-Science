They both handle the same methods for size(), is_empty() and to string() with a very slight difference for to_string(), for queue it walks along the chain from the front whereas for Stack is walks along the chain from the top.2. Same attributes and methods with some slight differences such as for peek() method for the Stack It gets data from the top of the stack whereas for Queue it gets data from the front due to their structures. As well as pop and dequeue, same names and same operations however they differ to the differences in their structure. The same applies to enqueue() and push() however there is a larger difference here, enqueue adds a value to the back of the queue whereas push() adds a value to the top of the Stack this is due to stack’s LIFO rule and Queue’s FIFO rule. Queue also has one more attribute than Stack which is the ‘back’ attribute which is necessary to enqueue, Stack does not need this due to its LIFO rule.3. The similarities definitely did help since I didn’t have to worry about like 3 methods and the ones that did have differences were very slight differences that didn’t cause too many bug and/or difficulties. The Stack was obviously slightly easier since the only real difficulty was properly coding the enqueue method for the queue since we are now adding a value to the back instead of the front or ‘top’ like the Stack.

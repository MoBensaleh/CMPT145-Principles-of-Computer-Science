# CMPT 145: Linear ADTs
# Implements a finite capacity Queue
#
# A queue (also called a FIFO queue) is a compound data
# structure in which the data values are ordered according to
# the FIFO (first-in first-out) protocol.
#
# This style of queue has a fixed capacity, defined
# when the queue is created.  Enqueue operations
# will add the given data to the queue, as long as
# the number of values in the queue is less than the
# capacity.  If the length of the queue is equal to the
# capacity, the value cannot be added.

# TO-DO complete the implementations

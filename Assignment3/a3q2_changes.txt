The count  function returns the number of values recorded from input, if no data was seen, 0 is returned. Maximum and minimum functions returns the smallest and largest value from the Statistics record input. If no data was seen, None is returned.- For test_create from the test script I added 2 new values ‘None’ to the output for the one test, these refer to the max and min operations. I tested the initial max and min by adding if statements for each in test_create.- Finally, I created test cases for the 3 new functions; count, max and min.

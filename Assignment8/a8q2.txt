In fact, this call will never succeed(except for empty tree), because, reflect function returns None(it changes the tree in memory), so you are always passing None as second argument to your mirror function.   => mirrored(atree, reflection(atree)): As reflection function gets called first, and it returns a mirrored copy of original tree, hence both trees are different and contain data in mirrored faishon.. thus mirrored function returns true.
